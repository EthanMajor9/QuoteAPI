# QuoteAPI
A simple backend API built using Express.js for managing Quotes.

## Overview
QuoteAPI is a backend service that allows you to store, manage, and share memorable quotes. This project is designed to work in tandem with the Quotable frontend application, offering an intuitive platform for capturing and sharing moments and memories among friends.

## Background
The inspiration for this project came from a personal experience. For the past couple of years, my friends and I have been using a Discord channel to keep track of our funniest quotes. However, I wanted a more robust and elegant solution for this purpose. QuoteAPI was created to address this need, providing a centralized repository for storing and sharing favorite quotes.

## Features
- Store quotes with relevant metadata (e.g., author, timestamp, context).
- Retrieve, update, and delete quotes via RESTful endpoints.
- Integrate with the Quotable frontend application for a seamless user experience.

## Integration with Quotable

QuoteAPI is designed to work alongside the Quotable frontend application, which provides a user-friendly interface for accessing and managing quotes. You can find the Quotable repository <a href="https://github.com/EthanMajor9/Quotable"> here </a>.
